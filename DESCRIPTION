Description: Toolbox for statistics of normal distributed populations.
 
 This toolbox provides elemantary tests for evaluation of measuring data. It 
 calculates the range of dispersion of the values and the mean regarding a 
 given statistical confidence level.
 
 These functions are good to extend the built-in functions mean(), stdev(), 
 max(), min(), median().
 
 The toolbox SampleStat provide the following functions (details refer example 
 below).
 
 MACROS:
 
   * SS_strayarea: 
     Calculates the stray area (range of dispersion of the values) 
     for a given vector and for a statistical confidence level (95%, 99%, 99.9%)
     and level of significance (0.5, 0.01, 0.001), resp.
   * SS_trustarea: 
     Calculates the trust area (range of dispersion of the mean) 
     for a given vector and for a statistical confidence level (95%, 99%, 99.9%)
     and level of significance (0.5, 0.01, 0.001), resp.
   * SS_studentfactor: 
     Determines the student factor for an amount of numbers and for a
     statistical confidence level (95%, 99%, 99.9%) and level of 
     significance (0.5, 0.01, 0.001), resp.- service function for 
     SS_staryarea and SS_trustarea
   * SS_demo.sce: 
     Demo for mean evaluation via "SS_strayarea()" and "SS_trustarea()"
         
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   
 EXAMPLE:
 
   v = [9.999 9.998 10.002  10. 10.001  10.];
 
   SS_strayarea(v, "95%") // confidence level in percent OR
   SS_strayarea(v, 0.05)  // confidence level of significance
   => ans = 0.0036345
 
   SS_trustarea(v, "95") // OR
   SS_trustarea(v, 0.05)
   => ans = 0.0014838
   
   95% of the values will be expected around 10.000 +/- 0.004 (Range 
   of dispersion of the values, stray area). With a propability of 95%
   the mean of 10.000 will stray around 10.000 +/- 0.001 (Rage of 
   dispersion of the mean, trust area).
